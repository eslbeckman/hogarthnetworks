This repository hosts the networks for the Hogarth Networks project by Emma Beckman. This project was undertaken in 2024-2025 for the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities through the NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science at Northeastern University. 

This data was collected from A Checklist of the Hogarth Press, 1917-1946 by J. Howard Woolmer and Mary E. Gaither (Revere, PA: Woolmer Brotherson Ltd., 1986), available on Internet Archive. 

There are two networks in this repository: a unimodal network, where all the nodes are people, and a bimodal network, where the nodes are both people and books.
